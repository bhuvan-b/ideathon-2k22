Flawless is a unique event to help participants understand the importance of a well-designed business strategy and test their potential to build a successful strategy. As in the name, the event revolves around understanding and building flawless business models. A well-laid business strategy helps a company stay perceptive and feel more purpose-oriented. Now, most people are aware of successful companies but only a few study what led them to their success. Even fewer people question why a particular company failed or reflect upon the flaws in its business model/strategy. Through Flawless, we aim to encourage the latter thinking because even though success stories are motivating, failure stories are the ones that teach valuable lessons.",
